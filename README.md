For this assignment I scraped the websites needed to collect images, text, and URLs.

I first started with Jupyter Notebook to go through each step in the scraping. And then we created the scraping and the app.py in Python to create the routes and and database. We then put together the html using boostrap to show the scrape route and the results from scraping.
